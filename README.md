# St_Andrews_Templates
This is a GitHub repo for Overleaf templates that are specific to the School of International Relations at the University of St Andrews. At the moment, I have only included a thesis template and the requisite images, but will expand it to eventually include Beamer presentations, etc. 

When it comes to the bibliography, you will need to make a references tab; entitled "references.bib" and it should follow this format: 
@article{Nutley2020,
    author  = {Nutley, Katelyn},
    title   = {Advanced Research Methods},
    journal = {Journal of Academic Studies},
    year    = {2020},
    volume  = {45},
    pages   = {100-115}
}

@book{Nutley2025,
    author  = {Nutley, Katelyn},
    title   = {Text to Advanced Research Methods},
    publisher = {Oxford University Press},
    year    = {2025}
}
