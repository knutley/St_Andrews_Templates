\chapter{Sample Text}

This is a sample text. Here's a useful definition:
\begin{definition}[A cool person]
    A cool person is a person who uses this thesis template.
\end{definition}

We can now state and prove the following theorem:
\begin{theorem}[True Theorem]
    Cool people get PhDs.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    I have discovered a truly marvellous proof of this, which this margin is too narrow to contain.
\end{proof}

We can use the self-defined commands $\C$ and $\arctg(\pi)$ as above.

You can make a table, and it'll appear in the list of tables above, after the table of contents.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c}
        A & B  \\
        C & D
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{First Table}
    \label{tab:first_table}
\end{table}

Note that the tabular environment on its own is not enough, you need the table environment for it to show up.

\newpage

You can also make figures, which will appear in the list of figures above, after the list of tables.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{01-foundation-vertical-black-text.png}
    \caption{First Figure}
    \label{fig:first_figure}
\end{figure}

You can also cite a book \cite{Nutley2025} or an article \cite{Nutley2020} or whatever you like, which will show in the bibliography at the end. 

% Small note, some of our faculty seem to prefer in-text citations so clarify with your supervisor first. :)
